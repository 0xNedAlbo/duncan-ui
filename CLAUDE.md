# DUNCAN - Uniswap V3 Liquidity Risk Management Platform

## Project Vision

DUNCAN is an innovative DeFi risk management tool that helps users understand and manage risks when providing liquidity in Uniswap V3 pools. The platform focuses on **position planning, risk visualization, and hedging strategies** through integrated Hyperliquid short positions.

## Core Philosophy & Risk Framework

### Base/Quote Asset Terminology

**Strict terminology consistency across all trading pairs:**
- **Base Asset:** The asset whose price movement we track (usually more volatile)
- **Quote Asset:** The asset in which prices are expressed (reference value)

Examples:
- ETH/USDC: Base=ETH, Quote=USDC â†’ "ETH price in USDC"
- WBTC/WETH: Base=WBTC, Quote=WETH â†’ "WBTC price in WETH"
- LINK/USDC: Base=LINK, Quote=USDC â†’ "LINK price in USDC"

### Risk Definition

**Risk = Value loss measured in Quote Asset units**

- No external risks (smart contract hacks, wallet loss, etc.)
- Pure focus on position value changes
- For stable quote assets (USDC/USDT) = USD equivalent loss
- For volatile quote assets (ETH) = loss in that specific asset

**Examples:**
- ETH/USDC position with 5000 USDC invested â†’ Risk = loss below 5000 USDC value
- WBTC/WETH position with 10 WETH invested â†’ Risk = loss below 10 WETH value

### Risk/Reward Framework

**Unified measurement in Quote Asset:**
- **Risk:** Potential loss in Quote Asset units
- **Reward:** Potential gain in Quote Asset units  
- **Position Goal:** Maximize Quote Asset value

## The Three-Phase Risk Structure

### Core Concept: Uniswap V3 PnL Curve

The **iconic PnL curve** represents the fundamental asymmetric risk in V3 positions through three distinct phases:

#### Phase 1: Below Range - Linear Downside Risk
- **Exposure:** 100% Base Asset (e.g., ETH)
- **Risk:** Fully exposed to base asset price decline
- **Curve Shape:** Linear downward slope (1:1 with base asset price)

#### Phase 2: In Range - Concentrated Liquidity Risk  
- **Exposure:** Mixed (rebalancing between Base/Quote)
- **Risk:** Impermanent Loss through constant rebalancing
- **Curve Shape:** Increasingly flat slope (diminishing returns)

#### Phase 3: Above Range - Capped Upside
- **Exposure:** 100% Quote Asset (e.g., USDC)
- **Risk:** Missing upside gains from base asset appreciation
- **Curve Shape:** Flat plateau (no further gains)

### Key Insight: Asymmetric Risk

**"You trade unlimited downside risk for limited upside potential"**

This asymmetry is what most LP providers don't understand. The visualization makes it immediately clear:
- **Red Zone (left):** Linear losses with base asset decline
- **Green Zone (center):** Fee collection with IL costs - the "optimal range"
- **Yellow Zone (right):** Missed gains from base asset pumps
