# Position Event Ledger - Production Implementation Documentation

## Overview

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED - PRODUCTION READY**

This document describes the **successfully implemented** event-based position ledger system for accurate PnL calculation in DUNCAN. The system is currently in production, tracking all position lifecycle events (creation, increases, decreases, fee collections) to provide precise historical valuations and comprehensive PnL breakdowns.

**Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL** 🎉

## Problem Statement (SOLVED ✅)

**Previous limitation:** Simple PnL calculation using:
```
PnL = currentValue - initialValue
```

**These problems have been SOLVED in production:**
1. ✅ **Fee tracking implemented** - All collected fees now included in PnL calculations
2. ✅ **Historical accuracy achieved** - Uses actual entry prices from blockchain events
3. ✅ **Realized vs unrealized separation** - Clear distinction between withdrawn funds and paper gains
4. ✅ **Full transparency provided** - Complete PnL attribution to specific blockchain events

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION: Event-Driven Architecture

### Core Concept (IN PRODUCTION)

**Successfully implemented:** Track every position action as immutable events with historical pricing:
```
Total PnL = Σ(all events valued at historical prices) + currentUnrealizedValue
```

**Production Status:** This formula is actively calculating PnL for all positions with event data.

### Event Types

1. **CREATE** - Initial position creation (first IncreaseLiquidity)
2. **INCREASE** - Additional liquidity added
3. **DECREASE** - Partial liquidity removal  
4. **COLLECT** - Fee collection without liquidity change
5. **CLOSE** - Complete position closure (liquidity = 0)

## ✅ PRODUCTION DATABASE SCHEMA

### PositionEvent Model (IMPLEMENTED)

**Migration:** `20250908141957_add_position_event_ledger`  
**Status:** ACTIVE in production database

  positionId      String
  position        Position @relation(fields: [positionId], references: [id])
  
  // Event Type & Identity
  eventType       String   // "CREATE", "INCREASE", "DECREASE", "COLLECT", "CLOSE"

  // Historical Pricing
  poolPrice       String   // BigInt: token0/token1 price at event time
  tick            Int      // Pool tick at event time
  
  // Valuations (in Quote Token smallest unit)
  valueInQuote    String   // BigInt: total position value change
  feeValueInQuote String?  // BigInt: fee value in quote token
  
  // Metadata
  source          String   // "subgraph", "onchain", "manual"
  confidence      String   // "exact", "estimated"
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  
  // Indexes for performance
  @@index([positionId, timestamp])
  @@index([positionId, eventType])
  @@index([transactionHash]) // Deduplication
}
```

## PnL Calculation Logic

### Event-Based Formula

```typescript
// For each position, calculate from events:

// 1. Track all money flows
const invested = events
  .filter(e => ['CREATE', 'INCREASE'].includes(e.eventType))
  .reduce((sum, e) => sum + BigInt(e.valueInQuote), 0n);

const withdrawn = events
  .filter(e => ['DECREASE', 'CLOSE'].includes(e.eventType))
  .reduce((sum, e) => sum + BigInt(e.valueInQuote), 0n);

const feesCollected = events
  .filter(e => e.eventType === 'COLLECT')
  .reduce((sum, e) => sum + BigInt(e.feeValueInQuote || '0'), 0n);

// 2. Get current state
const currentValue = await calculateCurrentPositionValue(positionId);
const unclaimedFees = await getUnclaimedFees(positionId);

// 3. Calculate PnL components
const realizedPnL = withdrawn + feesCollected - 
  (invested * withdrawn) / (invested - withdrawn + currentValue); // Proportional cost basis

const unrealizedPnL = currentValue + unclaimedFees - 
  (invested - (invested * withdrawn) / (invested - withdrawn + currentValue)); // Remaining cost basis

const totalPnL = realizedPnL + unrealizedPnL;
```

### Cost Basis Tracking

Key insight: When liquidity is withdrawn, we need to track what portion of the original investment it represents.

```typescript
// Example: $1000 invested, position now worth $1200
// User withdraws $600 worth of liquidity
// Cost basis of withdrawn amount = $1000 * ($600 / $1200) = $500
// Realized PnL = $600 - $500 = $100
// Remaining cost basis = $1000 - $500 = $500
```

## Data Flow Integration

### Refresh Position Flow (Updated)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks refresh] --> B[Verify ownership]
    B --> C[Rate limiting check]
    C --> D[Update pool state]
    D --> E[Sync position events]
    E --> F[Fetch historical prices]
    F --> G[Calculate event-based PnL]
    G --> H[Return enhanced position data]
```

### Event Sync Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[syncPositionEvents] --> B[Get last sync timestamp]
    B --> C[Query Subgraph for new events]
    C --> D[For each event...]
    D --> E[Get historical price at timestamp]
    E --> F[Calculate value in quote token]
    F --> G[Store event in database]
    G --> H[Update position metadata]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

1. **Historical Prices:** Cache poolDayData/poolHourData responses
2. **Event Calculations:** Cache PnL calculations with TTL
3. **Batch Processing:** Sync multiple positions' events in parallel

### Database Optimizations

1. **Indexes:** Position + timestamp, Position + eventType
2. **Partitioning:** Consider partitioning events by date for large datasets
3. **Aggregates:** Cache frequently calculated sums in Position model

### Subgraph Query Optimization

1. **Incremental Sync:** Only fetch events newer than lastEventSync
2. **Batch Queries:** Fetch multiple positions' events in single query
3. **Price Batching:** Fetch historical prices for multiple timestamps

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Missing Historical Data

If historical price unavailable:
1. Use interpolation between nearest available prices
2. Fall back to current price with "estimated" confidence
3. Log data gaps for manual review

### Subgraph Failures

1. Retry with exponential backoff
2. Fall back to current PnL calculation method
3. Queue positions for later sync attempt
4. Notify monitoring system

### Data Consistency

1. Transaction wrapping for event sync
2. Validation against known position state
3. Audit trail for all changes
4. Rollback capability for bad data

## ✅ TESTING STRATEGY: IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ Unit Tests (IMPLEMENTED)

1. ✅ **EventSyncService:** Subgraph response mocking, event parsing tested
2. ✅ **EventPnlService:** PnL calculations tested with realistic scenarios in `eventPnlService.test.ts`
3. ✅ **HistoricalPriceService:** Price interpolation accuracy verified

### ✅ Integration Tests (IMPLEMENTED)

1. ✅ **End-to-end sync:** Production positions with real event history
2. ✅ **PnL accuracy:** Event-based calculations verified against known positions
3. ✅ **Performance:** Sync times optimized and benchmarked

### ✅ Test Data (IMPLEMENTED)

**Production-ready test factory system includes:**
- ✅ Positions with simple event history (create, collect, close)
- ✅ Positions with complex history (multiple increases/decreases) 
- ✅ Positions with missing historical data (graceful fallbacks)
- ✅ Edge cases handled (zero liquidity periods, failed syncs)

**Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests in place
